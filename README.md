# Na-ve-Bees-Image-Loading-and-Processing
# Na√Øve Bees Project Series
This project consists of 3 sub-projects arranged such that:
1. Image Loading and Processing
2. Predict Species from Images
3. Deep Learning with Images

## Image Loading and Processing
Load, transform, and understand images of honey bees and bumble bees in Python.

Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this Project, we will use the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data. We'll learn common transformations of images and how to build them into a pipeline.

This project is the first part of a series of projects that walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.
